# ItemRaffle

## Description

- IR(ItemRaffle) is a **chance based jackpot** system
- Players can deposit to a pool for a chance to win a prize.
- When the pool drawing timer is up, and let's say there are only two participating players: player Alice and player Bob.
    - Player Alice deposits `$100` and player Bob deposits `$100`.
    - Total value of the jackpot is `$200`.
    - Player Alice has a winning chance of `Player Alice deposit / total value` = `100 / 200 = 50%`.
    - Player Bob has a winning chance of `Player Bob deposit / total value` = `100 / 200 = 50%`.
